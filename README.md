# BREAST-CANCER-PREDICTOR-APP

Breast cancer is a form of tumor that develops in the breast tissues. It is the most frequent cancer in women worldwide, and it is one of the leading causes of mortality in women. Therefore, early detection and diagnosis will benefit patients who have breast cancer. This paper has compared nine supervised machine learning techniques named Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Logistic Regression (LR), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), XGBoost Classifier (XGB) and AdaBoost Classifier (ADB) in order to classify the tumors into benign and malignant. The data set is from the UCI Machine Learning repository, which is used for predicting breast cancer. The performance of models is measured with respect to the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
